important tips

It nedds to mention that the xlable of time at the bottom of the plot2/plot3/plot4 are in Chinese, because my system(windows) is based in Chinese.
Since it is more clear for me to look at the graphs in Chinese, I remain weekdays in Chinese character instead of in English.

To help you better understand my project, here is a list for you to check~

"星期四"=Thu

"星期五"=Fri

"星期六"=Sat
