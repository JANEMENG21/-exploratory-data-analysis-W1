## folder "figure"
I have conloned this from the professor's repo. I found that the *folder "figure"* are not necessary, so I deleted it for tidiness. I apologize for the inconvenience I might brought.

## xlable of time
It nedds to mention that the *xlable of time* at the bottom of the plot2/plot3/plot4 are in Chinese, because my system(windows) is based in Chinese.
Since it is more clear for me to look at the graphs in Chinese, I remain weekdays in Chinese character instead of in English.

To help you better understand my project, here is a list for you to check~

"星期四"=Thu
